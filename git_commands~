git init -> creates a new repository for current project in current directory. Creates a .git directory containing all info about this project.
git add <filename/directory name> -> adds file to this repository. If directory name is given, all files are added recursively. These files added will be in tracked state, and staged.
** If file given is untracked, this command adds it to tracked status and staged.
** If file given is tracked, this command gives it staged status.

git status -> tells status of files, whether tracked or tracked and whether staged, modified or commited.

git diff --staged -> to see what will is staged.

git commit ->  commits current staged files. Can add message to editor opened or directly give message by giving -m option and then entering 
message. Can also give -v option to be verbose about commiting.
