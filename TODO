1. Merge hypercubes of clause along some dimension after making disjoint in decomposer (because segments break and thus we can merge 
them)
2. In splitting, If approximate is true, then split the segment according to random number only. Now splitting is occuring on all cases
i.e. nc0, nc1,...ncCn, but we are choosing only one out of them based on random number. Instead, we can only split on only 1 case
3. Remove parentMln in binomialSplitterSegment, as done in nonbinomialSplitterSegment
